## Description

### Scoring

- You can earn points by bouncing off a ball with the paddle which you can move with your mouse.
- The speed of the ball increases and colors of the ball and the paddle change each time the ball gets deflected.
- The ball bounces off the wall except for the bottom side.

- If you are not careful, the ball will roll outside of the screen through the bottom side. You will lose a life point each time that happens. 
- If you had more than 10 points before you missed the ball, your score will be deducted accordingly.

- When the ball goes out of the screen and if you have more than 0 life point, the ball will respawn on random position of the screen with decreased speed if the speed was over 15.
